        <b>The Living Room</b>: Cozy up for a little Netflix to unwind. We've been really impressed by the quality and immersiveness of our 60" Vizio TV. It connects to Netflix, Spotify, etc. and there's also a Chromecast connected.

### Here's what you'll love about our place:

#### The House
- 1,200 sq. ft., 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms with a bonus room (in addition to the living room). We just use one bedroom and the other spaces as offices.
- The house is furnished, comfy and super-functional.
- Driveway for you to park in if you have a car
- Garage with some storage-space (our car will be inside)
- Washer-dryer, dishwasher and everything else you need to live comfortably

#### The Location
- It's just 10 minutes from downtown so you can enjoy the city without living the cramped lifestyle
- This is an amazing neighborhood, really close to great restaurants, parks, the supermarket, the gym and more (we'll have tons of recommendations for you).
- **Bus stop across the street** that takes you right downtown in 10 minutes. It's like having your own personal shuttle (round-trip costs $2.50 and can be bought from the CapMetro appâ€”it's so easy!)

#### The Productivity

- Super-fast Internet (300 down/20 up from Time Warner but Google Fiber will probably be installed by the time you get here!)
- Nice big desk in the main office for you to take-over
- Great sound-system to blast your music as you get to work

#### The Comfort
- Central A/C to fend off the Texas heat plus a whole-house fan if you just want to air out the place
- An insanely comfy queen-size bed with a Helix Sleep Mattress and bamboo sheets so you'll get an amazing night's sleep
- Skylights in the kitchen, living room and bathroom so you'll have nice natural light all day long
- We have a nice big backyard that's great for enjoying the sunny Austin days, especially with friends (we put up strings of lights so you can enjoy the nights too!)
- There's a grill outside so you can get grillin' and smokin' to your heart's content
